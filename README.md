# Security Product Evaluation Templates

## Overview
This repository provides open-source, manufacturer-independent templates for evaluating security products. These templates are designed to help security teams assess solutions based on objective criteria and real-world use cases. 

### Why This Project?
With the vast number of security products available, organizations need a structured way to evaluate tools based on functionality, scalability, integration, and operational efficiency. These templates provide a standardized approach to product evaluation, reducing bias and vendor lock-in.
